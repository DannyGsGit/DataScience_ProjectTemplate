# Data Dictionary

The data dictionary contains the customer-provided definitions of the data assets. For a typical column-oriented database, this would be a definition of
column headers. Documentation should include, when available:

* Name
* Description
* Type of variable (text, integer, decimal, etc.)
* Values

Dictionaries can be automatically generated and enforced in R with the [websteR R package](https://github.com/DannyGsGit/websteR).
