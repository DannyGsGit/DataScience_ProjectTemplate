# Operationalization Code

This section contains any code related to the operational deployment of a model, which could include Markdown reports, Shiny apps,
a code package, or a simple prediction script. 

Note that if the deployment method is a package, that package should also be placed in a standalone repository, independent of the 
experimental documentation contained in this project repository.
